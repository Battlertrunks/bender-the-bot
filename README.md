## Bender the Bot: Discord Bot

### What is this?
This is a discord bot used to help around with user request, provide entertainment, information, and more. This bot will be built out as time goes with more features and actions.

### Why?
This bot is mainly here for practice using python, but also building bots in chatrooms and outside of this scope too in the future. I hope in the future to build out a more detailed bot that will be more independent from Discord's bot API.

### Who can use this?
Anyone can use this, but you will need to set it up on your own server and provide the right data for it to run. Not everything on this repo is ready for you to use.
